# ShiftSmoothedAttributions
### Ian Nielsen Systems Devices and Algorithms in Bioinformatics Final Project Spring 2021

## Quickstart:

### Codon Detection Task

Move to project repository.

``cd ShiftSmoothedAttributions\Codon_Detection``

To recreate Experiment 1 (Shifting Invariance) run the shift experiment file.

``python shift_experiment.py``

To recreate Experiment 2 (Are the Areas of Interest Being Highlighted?) Run the display logo file to display the attribution maps given in this repo.

``python disp_attr_motif_logo.py``


### Human/Goldfish Classification Task

Move to project repository.

``cd ShiftSmoothedAttributions\Human_Goldfish_Classification``

To recreate Experiment 1 (Shifting Invariance) run the shift experiment file.

``python shift_experiment.py``

To recreate Experiment 2 (Are the Areas of Interest Being Highlighted?) Run the display logo file to display the attribution maps given in this repo. **Note: this experiment will not be able to validate the method the same as the codon detection task since the important features are not known for human/goldfish classification.**

``python disp_attr_logo.py``


## Train Model:
**If you would like to train the model yourself follow these steps**
